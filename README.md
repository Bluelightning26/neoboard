I made this project as LEDs are fun and Neopixels sit right on the board in a flush, neat way. I wanted a project that can sit on my desk and look cool while being fun and interactive. I started PixelDust but didn't come close to finishing, and figured- why not work on a matrix when waiting for my HackPad (v2) and Solder PCB to ship

How to put it together?
The top and the bottom of the case will be hot glued together. I was thinking of putting an acrylic sheet on the front to help give it a diffused look, but I'd like the PCB to be easily visable to give it a unique look.
